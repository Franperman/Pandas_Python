World Cities Data Separation by Country

This Python script separates world cities data by country and saves each dataset into a separate XLSX file.
Usage

    Make sure you have the pandas and openpyxl libraries installed.
    Download the worldcities.csv file containing the world cities data.
    Run the separate_cities_by_country.py script.

The script will read the CSV file, group the data by country, and save each dataset into a separate XLSX file, with a maximum of 248 entries per file.
Configuration

You can adjust the maximum number of entries per file by modifying the MAX_ENTRIES_PER_FILE variable in the script.
